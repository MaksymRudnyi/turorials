# @lezer/cpp

This is a C++ grammar for the
[Lezer](https://lezer.codemirror.net/) parser system.

The grammar used is based in a large part on the corresponding
[tree-sitter grammar](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-cpp).

It should be noted that really parsing C++ without a symbol table and
a preprocessor is not really something that is _possible_. The
language is very, very ambiguous when parsed like that. This grammar
tries to pick a likely parse, but is entirely capable of picking the
wrong one.
