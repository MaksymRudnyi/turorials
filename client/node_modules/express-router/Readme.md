  **express-router** is a library for organizing routes of an express application
## Usage

  **express-router** lets you write your express routes in a simpler way.
  You just have to create a 'routes' folder inside your project and place your routes in an index.txt file.
  
  So your app will be structured like this:
  - app.js
  - /routes/
    - index.txt
    - products.js
    - users.js

Then, in your app.js, you just do this after defining app = express():

```js
require('express-router')();
```

  If you want to use another folder for routes:

```js
require('express-router')('thisismynewroutesfolder');
```

  If you do not want to define 'app' globally (**express-router** will check for global.app):

```js
var app = express();
require('express-router')(app);
```

  Or both:

```js
var app = express();
require('express-router')('thisismynewroutesfolder', app);
```

  Finally you structure your routes in the index.txt file like this: method url middleware1,middleware2,...,middlewareN (empty lines and comments are supported):

  ```
  //BEGIN PRODUCT ROUTES
  GET /products products.list
  POST /products products.create
  GET /shoes products.shoes.find,products.shoes.list
  //END PRODUCT ROUTES

  //BEGIN USER ROUTES
  GET /users/new users.new
  POST /users/:user users.show
  //END USER ROUTES
  ```

## Installation

    $ npm install express-router
